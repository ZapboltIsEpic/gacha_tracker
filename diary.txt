20/11/24:
- Finally got AWS EC2 Server to load up angular app instead of "welcome to nginx" page
- The fix was to add a nginx.conf file and instead of copying from /usr/src/app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
  it was /usr/src/app/dist/client/browser /usr/share/nginx/html

21/11/24:
- fixed package.json file so that server can run with node dist/server.js
- added environments to frontend so that api calling is flexible
- connected backend to ec2 server

04/02/24:
- Figured out that I want to do ZZZ page as the goal for the next few weeks/month
